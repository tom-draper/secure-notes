## Getting Started

```bash
docker compose up -d

## Example Use Cases

### Class Feedback

At the end of a semester, a lecturer requests feedback from their students. They ask their students to open the Secure Notes instance hosted on a University campus server, enter the module ID and submit feedback anonymously.

### Safeguarding

A substitute teacher at a Primary School notices a child in the class appears underweight. They connect to the school's Secure Notes webpage set up for the staff to use and enter the student's ID. They register their observation anonymously with a new note and notice a number of concerning notes previously submitted before deciding to raise the issue with their superior.

### Questions for Speaker

At a yearly keynote event, the audience is encouraged to submit questions for the guest speaker. They scan a QR code on the screen which takes them to the Secure Notes URL for the talk to submit anonymous questions.
