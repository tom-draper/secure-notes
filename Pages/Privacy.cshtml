    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><b>Secure Notes</b> is an open-source project that allows users to create and view notes stored against unique
        Note IDs. This
        privacy policy explains how data is handled within the service and important considerations for users.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The service collects and stores only the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Note content (text submitted by users)</li>
        <li>Note IDs</li>
        <li>Timestamps of note creation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We intentionally do not collect or store:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User identification information</li>
        <li>IP addresses</li>
        <li>Browser information</li>
        <li>Cookies</li>
        <li>Any personal data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Important Deployment Considerations</h2>
    <div class="alert">
        <p>Please be aware that Secure Notes is a self-hosted application. This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The security and privacy of your data depends entirely on the trustworthiness of the party hosting this
                instance</li>
            <li>Different instances of Secure Notes may be operated by different organizations or individuals</li>
            <li>The hosting party has full access to all stored notes and could potentially:
                <ul>
                    <li>View any note content</li>
                    <li>Modify stored notes</li>
                    <li>Track additional information beyond what is specified above</li>
                    <li>Modify the application's behavior</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Notes are encrypted and stored in a database controlled by the hosting party</li>
        <li>Data retention policies may vary depending on the specific deployment</li>
        <li>While notes are encrypted, the hosting party may maintain access to the encryption keys</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recommendations for Users</h2>
    <p>To ensure your privacy and security:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not include identifying information within notes</li>
        <li>Consider who is hosting the instance before using it for sensitive communications</li>
        <li>If privacy is crucial, consider hosting your own instance of Secure Notes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy may be updated by the hosting party. Check this page periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions about this privacy policy or the handling of data on this instance, contact the hosting party
        directly.</p>

    <p><em>Note: This is a base privacy policy for Secure Notes. The hosting party may modify this policy or add
            additional terms specific to their deployment.</em></p>

    <p>The project is free to use and fully open-source on <a
